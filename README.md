## Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks for Medicinal Plant Identification

This project introduces a Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based approach for the accurate and efficient identification of medicinal plants. By training on a dataset of 117 plant species, the system utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract fine-grained morphological features from leaf samples, overcoming traditional identification challenges like geographical limitations and dependence on experts.

### Key Features:
- **Automated Classification**: Identifies medicinal plants with 97% accuracy.
- **Robust Dataset**: Includes diverse, preprocessed images for improved model robustness.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Facilitates plant identification via mobile and web applications.
- **Scalable and Adaptable**: Designed for use in agriculture, medicine, and botanical research.

### Methodology:
1. **Dataset Preparation**: Collection and preprocessing of leaf images.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Utilizes CNN layers for texture and shape analysis.
3. **Model Training**: Fine-tuned parameters for high accuracy and generalization.
4. **Evaluation and Deployment**: Metrics-driven performance validation and user-ready application deployment.

This project bridges traditional medicinal knowledge with modern AI-driven solutions, fostering sustainability and innovation in medicinal plant research.
